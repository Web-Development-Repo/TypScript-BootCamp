# TypeScript-BootCamp

This Bootcamp features hands-on coding lab experiments which are both fun and useful. 
They will help you understand concepts and play around with TypeScript features. 
You will have the opportunity to keep those examples for your reference as we advance ourselves to learn more TypeScript features in this series of upcoming Bootcamps.
